🗂️ Daily Dev Log

This repository is a development journal where I share code from challenges, exercises, and small projects.
The main goal is to practice coding every day and keep consistency on GitHub.

🎯 Goals

Maintain daily commits.

Strengthen my skills as a Salesforce Developer (Apex, LWC, SOQL).

Explore and practice with other technologies such as Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, React, SQL, among others.

Use this repo as a space for continuous learning.

📌 Note

This repository is mainly for educational and personal practice.
